# Heart-Attack-Data-Analysis
Heart attacks remain a major clinical and financial burden. Data shows 53.7% of patients have heart disease, with men (68.3%) and adults 60+ most affected, though cases are rising in ages 40–49. We recommend a $750K Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Program targeting hypertension and diabetes to prevent incidents and improve outcomes.
